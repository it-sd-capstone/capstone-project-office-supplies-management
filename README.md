# Capstone Project: Office Supplies Management

### Before cloning/forking...
1.  Download [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

2.  Download [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&passive=false&cid=2030) (this link downloads automatically).

3.  Clone/fork the project to a directory of your choosing.

4.  Run the project once, which will use a stub function to instantiate the database.

### Additionally...
The database's records can be updated/added within Visual Studio, but any changes to the database's design (such as altering relationships, changing primary/foreign keys, changing column names, or adding tables) are more easily done in MYSQL.
